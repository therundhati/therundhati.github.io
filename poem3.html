Is overcoming the fears bravey, or is it getting stuff done despite them? Honestly, I'll never know. Here's my coping mchanism and personal pep talk- it's okay to be scared and amazing to take a step towards them, even more amazing than a step possibly against them :) </p>

Fear, an emotion, overwhelmingly strong, <br> <br>
Clouding priorities, goals, dreams and right and wrong. <br> <br>
Uproot and face your fears, they say, <br> <br>
But is it really so easy to thwart what I wake up to each day? <br> <br>
Do ambition and passion drive my actions, or is it fear, really, <br> <br>
The fear of failure or that of everyone ahead of me. <br> <br>
The fear of disappointment, of shattering expectations, <br> <br>
Pushing me more than any promise of reward or motivations. <br> <br>
The road is lonely, difficult, full of obstacles, hunger and thirst. <br> <br>
So owing to my pre judgement I hesitate to take even the step first. <br> <br>
And thus, fear knowlingly feeds judgements, superstitions, insecurities, <br> <br>
Drawing a line on what I believe are my own possibilities. <br> <br>
I have not been caged, still there is fear’s spectre on my head, <br> <br>
Fear kills more dreams than failure ever will, it’s said. <br> <br> <br> <br>

It had never been easy, it had never been fair, <br> <br>
But what counts is the courage to dream, do and dare. <br> <br>
And it’s not always about the big decisions I make, <br> <br>
It’s about what I pursue and what chances I willingly take. <br> <br>
My biggest fears have carried my greatest growth, experiences, strife. <br> <br>
Fear never did fade, but some things were more important in life. <br> <br>
I have had to take this call whenever, <br> <br>
Fear feels temporary, recurring yet regrets last forever. <br> <br>
Only when the will to prove myself triumphs and clears the doubts’ pall, <br> <br>
The hope that it will be better and I will do better wins above all, <br> <br>
Faith and belief stand stronger than the monsters of my mind, <br> <br>
And greater guts, grit and glory I can find. <br> <br>
Perseverance and actions will keep the rest at bay, <br> <br>
Fear stands insignificant and for success clears the way. <br> <br>
And maybe one day I’ll be able to face and walk towards sunshine, <br> <br>
That’s the day when all my shadows will finally fall behind.</p> <br>
