            <p>
The Solitary Gambler; the stakes are high, <br> <br>
His mind and heart, true players; <br> <br>
He has his virtues and his monsters, <br> <br>
Muddling with love, happiness, worries and fears. <br> <br>
One man grows through the game of life, <br> <br>
His demons, like him, morphing continuously. <br> <br>
				 <br> <br>
Beginning as the impressionable Soldier,  <br> <br>
On the threshold of a future and no history. <br> <br>
Perceiving thoughts and things in ways yet a mystery. <br> <br>
The “unknown” to him arouses sensation, <br> <br>
He is yet to learn the fear of anticipation. <br> <br>
				 <br> <br>
Soon ready to take on the world. The Believer; <br> <br>
Of heavens in the sky and the demons down under. <br> <br>
What he sees with his eyes and mind, <br> <br>
Of tales and fables, and victory and plunder. <br> <br>
The darkest dark and pixie dust, shooting stars and magic burst. <br> <br>
				 <br> <br>
And then he grows into the Rebel, <br> <br>
With anxious first steps and emotions overwhelmingly strong. <br> <br>
The fear of disappointment and shattering expectations, <br> <br>
Clouding priorities, dreams, right and wrong. <br> <br>
Then a Soldier. Seeking guts, grit and glory, <br> <br>
Ready to thwart his monsters and pen down his story. <br> <br>
				 <br> <br>
Thus he slips into the midlife crisis, the Seasoned Pawn.  <br> <br>
Feeding judgements, superstitions, insecurities, <br> <br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances, <br> <br>
Drawing a line on what supposedly are his own possibilities. <br> <br>
And then he lies in retrospect, awaiting the inevitable. <br> <br>
The dawn long gone, darkness to stay. <br> <br>
Once shining eyes and youth and memories fading away. <br> <br>
				 <br> <br>
And then the time finally comes. <br> <br>
That ends this strange struggle and speculation; <br> <br>
When he is at solace and drunk in oblivion. <br> <br>
On the threshold of the unknown yet again. <br> <br>
				 <br> <br>
The game charts out <br> <br>
Of the king, clergy, knight, spectator, slave, sinner; <br> <br>
And if it were to end tonight, <br> <br>
Would you call yourself a Winner? <br> <br>
